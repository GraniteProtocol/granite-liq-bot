# Liquidation Bot (DEX)

## Introduction

Liquidation bot is responsible for liquidating user positions that are at risk.

## Main Components

Liquidation bot consist of two main components:

### Workers

Multiple workers sequentially to build borrower state and execute liquidations if necessary.

Worker cycle?


### contract-sync worker

Responsible for contract lock/unlock handling, liquidation record finalization, check sync activation, and balance updates.

If there is an ongoing transaction:

- It checks the transaction's status. If the status is not `pending` (i.e., the transaction is finalized), it schedules an unlock to be executed in 1 minute.
- Marks the corresponding liquidation record with the transaction's status code.
- Activates sync checks for affected users.
- Triggers the `onLiqTxEnd` alert.
- Finalizes any previously scheduled unlock, if applicable.

Then updates balances:

- Operator's STX balance
- Liquidator contract's market asset balance
- Liquidator contract's collateral asset balance


### event-sync worker

Event sync worker scans the Granite protocol smart contracts to extract borrower wallet addresses and inserts them into the `borrower` table.

**Followed contracts:**
- `borrower`
- `state`
- `liquidator`

**Tracked contract log types:**
- `borrow`
- `add-collateral`
- `remove-collateral`
- `deposit`
- `withdraw`
- `liquidate-collateral`
- `repay`

## borrower-sync worker

Responsible for fetching and building the borrower state by:

- Updating position data into the `borrower_position` table  
- Updating collateral data into the `borrower_collaterals` table  

This process runs only for users with check sync activated.


## market-sync worker

Collects, builds, and caches the necessary market state variables required to calculate liquidations.

Collected data is stored in the `kv_store` table to be shared with other workers/processes.

Data is fetched from the following smart contract methods:

- `ir.get-ir-params`
- `state.get-lp-params`
- `state.get-accrue-interest-params`
- `state.get-debt-params`
- `state.get-collateral`

## health-sync worker

Responsible for building up-to-date borrower health data using:

- Data collected by the workers listed above
- Pyth price feed

The calculated data is stored in the `borrower_status` table to share with other workers/processes in the following format:

```json
{
    "address": "SP1RG3YP9C8SC82GVHT1E1WG22MYHTCJ4FT3T9R4G",
    "ltv": 0.3054,
    "health": 1.4734,
    "debt": 10.2774,
    "collateral": 33.6504,
    "risk": 0.6787,
    "maxRepay": {
        "SM3VDXK3WZZSA84XXFKAFAF15NNZX32CTSG82JFQ4.sbtc-token": 200
    },
    "totalRepayAmount": 0
}
```

## liquidate worker

Reads borrower health data from the `borrower_status` table and triggers liquidation transactions if there are any applicable user positions.

---

### ðŸ§® Liquidation Batch

- Batches are sorted by `total_repay_amount DESC` to prioritize the largest liquidable positions.
- The batch size is limited by the contractâ€™s market asset balance.
- If the balance is insufficient to cover all liquidations, the last item in the batch (or the only one) will be a **partial liquidation**.

---

### ðŸ”’ Minimum to Liquidate per User

- Borrowers with a liquidation amount below `MIN_TO_LIQUIDATE_PER_USER` (defined in constants) are excluded from the batch.

---

### ðŸ“‰ Minimum Total to Liquidate

- If the **sum** of the liquidation batch is below `MIN_TO_LIQUIDATE` (defined in constants), the bot will skip the liquidation.

---

### ðŸ’° Profitability Check

- The bot ensures that the market asset balance **received** at the end of the operation is greater than or equal to what will be **spent**.
- If the check fails, the bot **skips** liquidation.
- When the `SKIP_PROFITABILITY_CHECK` environment variable is set to `"1"`, the bot will skip the profitability Check.

---

### ðŸ§ª Dry Run Mode

- When the `DRY_RUN` environment variable is set to `1`, the bot will **not broadcast** liquidation transactions.

---

### â›” Skipped If

The worker will skip liquidation in the following cases:

- No liquidator contract is set
- Liquidation contract is **locked** (i.e., a liquidation transaction is in progress)
- There is a borrower pending sync (via `borrower-sync` worker)
- No liquidable positions available
- The liquidation contract has **no market asset balance**
- The liquidation amount is smaller than `MIN_TO_LIQUIDATE`
- Profitability check fails
- Dry run mode is activated

### âœ… If all checks passes

The bot pushed broadbast liquidation transaction to blockchain.

**fee estimation**

The bot uses optimistically determined transaction fee depending on the blockchain's mempool size.

**nonce determination**

Using the Hiro api's `/extended/v1/address/${principal}/nonces` endpoint' `possible_next_nonce` key.
